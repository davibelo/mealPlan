### Agile Hierarchy Recap:

1. **Epic**: High-level goal or large body of work (e.g., "User Authentication and Account Management").
2. **Feature**: A smaller, more specific functionality within an epic (e.g., "User Registration").
3. **User Story**: A description of a functionality from the user's perspective (e.g., "As a user, I want to register with my email and password...").
